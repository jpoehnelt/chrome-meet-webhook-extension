      <p>
        The default webhook HTTP call is a <code>POST</code> having
        <code>Content-Type: application/json</code>. This can be overriden by
        prefixing the URL with the method such as
        <code>GET https://example.com</code>
      </p>
      <p>The body of POST requests matches the following:</p>
      <pre id="payload" class="bg-dark text-light p-3"></pre>
